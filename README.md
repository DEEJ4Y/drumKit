# drumKit

The [Drum Kit](https://davidjosephind.github.io/drumKit/) is one of the projects I have been working on as part of [The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) course. It is a website that displays my learnings in the Advanced JavaScript and DOM Manipulation modules in the course. The skeleton project was provided by [The App Brewery](https://www.appbrewery.co/). I was responsible for writing the JavaScript for the project.

The goal of this project was to understand the working of Advanced JavaScript concepts and more DOM Manipulation in websites.

### The things I learnt to use as I created this project:

- Adding event listeners to elements
- Higher Order Functions and Passing Functions as Arguments in JavaScript
- Playing sounds on websites
- Using switch statements in JavaScript
- Manipulating HTML Element Attributes
- Objects, Methods and their functioning in JavaScript
- Using keyboard event listeners
- Understanding callback functions and responding to events in JavaScript
- Adding simple animations to websites
